The exact truth of the tale is unknown... though it's certainly not unlike Imoen to encourage an old codger to not be such a stick-in-the-mud, and her later friendship with Elminster is well-documented. Later tales say Imoen founded a thieves guild that operated all the way to Neverwinter, sparred with the Shadow Thieves and the Zhentarim and even duelled a dragon because (so the story goes) \"he was rude\".

"Nalia grew quite powerful after her association with <CHARNAME>. Initially she traveled, slaking her thirst for magical lore by associating with some of the greatest wizards across the Realms. She sought to use her great power to bring justice to the land, but over time found that if her time with <CHARNAME> had taught her anything, it is that such power must be tempered with wisdom or it is useless. She could strike out at evil as she wished... it did not always help the needy, as she thought it would, and after a year of travel she remembered that there was a far better way that she could be of service to her people.\n"
"Nalia returned to Amn and her family home of de'Arnise Hold. She found it in the control of none other than Isaea Roenal, but she was no longer the wayward child that he expected, and single-handedly brought him to justice for his indiscretions. She declared herself the inheritor of her father's ducal title, and for once there was no argument from the local nobility. They snubbed her and her magic, and initially rejoiced when the Cowled Wizards sought to remove her from power. Nalia demonstrated to them all that she was no-one to trifle with, however, and the Cowled Wizards learned to fear her name. Over time Nalia became a beloved ruler, respected archmage, and eventually earned a seat on the Amnish Council of Six itself. The nobility grew to rely on Nalia's leadership, and she would become a prominent figure in Amn for many years, constantly fighting for the good of the common folk and making many frustrated enemies among the nobility and Cowled Wizards both. Nalia would die many years later, surrounded by a loving family... her last words would be to thank <CHARNAME> for so long ago showing her the true path she needed to walk."

Old enemies were startled by his visits, but never for long, and it was not even months later that Sarevok would start a reign of terror in Baldur's Gate that would place him completely in charge of the city. Resistance was crushed as Sarevok began raising an army for conquest in his own name. If he could not have the divine power of his father, he would have enough earthly power to satiate his appetite. Sarevok partook of women as he pleased as his name became a bitter epithet on the tongue of every citizen of the Sword Coast.\n"

In the end, his throne grew heavy, and it was with dread acceptance that he greeted the arrival of the inevitable heroes to displace him not a year after his return.\n"
"Sarevok fled into the night, abandoning Baldur's Gate and his dreams of power both. He became a man haunted by his second chance, hunted by a former life that never was and a possible life that never could be. Without a destiny and or a true soul of his own, he wandered the Realms... sometimes he brought terror and sometimes he brought nothing but his tired heart, and before long he was gone forever.

Upon being revived, Viconia was surprised to discover that this last act had prompted the Suldanessallar elves to finally accept and forgive their drow sister. Queen Ellesime granted the highest honors of the Seldarine to Viconia, the first drow ever honored so, and even invited Viconia to find a home in the Tree of Life once again.
