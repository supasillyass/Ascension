She wore many other names throughout her life, some mysterious and foreboding while others odd and quirky considering the power this great woman possessed. Anyone who had known Imoen in her youth would immediately recognize her despite any name, however... no amount of age or wisdom could disguise the mischievious twinkle in her eyes or the ready grin to greet a friend. She became the confidante of Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun and was oft-associated with a tale involving the great Elminster, supposedly picking the sage's pocket one day and then leading him on a merry magical chase across Faerun for four months. The exact truth of the tale is unknown... though it's certainly not unlike Imoen to encourage an old codger to not be such a stick-in-the-mud, and her later friendship with Elminster is well-documented. Later tales say Imoen founded a thieves guild that operated all the way to Neverwinter, sparred with the Shadow Thieves and the Zhentarim and even duelled a dragon because (so the story goes) \"he was rude\". At times, Imoen was known to think back on her old friend, <CHARNAME>, and smile sadly... and then immediately be possessed with a wickedly funny thought that would propel her onto her next scheme.
