"Upon parting paths with <CHARNAME>, Viconia wandered for a great deal of time.  She still met with ignorance and hatred from those who knew of her kind, but Viconia was determined now more than ever to establish herself as seperate from the legacy of the dark elves.  She had been to the deepest planes of hell and fought side-by-side with <CHARNAME> as <PRO_HESHE> became a God... and she would hide her face from the surface lands any longer.  Even when Shar, her goddess of darkness and loss, abandoned her completely Viconia was unrepetant.  Tales of her grew as she made her presence felt in one land after another... often as a savior, only to be thanklessly driven out by suspicion and fear.  Still Viconia traveled on, refusing the company of fellow travelers and adventurers and never finding anywhere that she could truly name a home.  Her destiny was her own, and she would seek it on her own terms.\n"
"What eventually become of Viconia is unknown.  Her greatest legend is also the most unlikely, although its persistence gives it some credit.  It is said that Viconia saved the elves of Suldanessalar from a Zhentarim plot, fighting valiantly against the organization's agents... and in the end placing herself in harm's way to save Queen Ellesime from a deadly arrow.  Upon being revived, Viconia was surprised to discover that this last act had prompted the Suldanessalar elves to finally accept and forgive their drow sister.  Queen Ellesime granted the highest honors of the Seldarine to Viconia, the first drow ever honored so, and even invited Viconia to find a home in the Tree of Life once again.  Viconia was obviously moved by the gesture... and while she considered the Queen's offer, it is said she eventually merely bowed deeply to Ellesime and silently left Suldanessalar forever.  Viconia was never reported seen again."

"Upon parting ways with <CHARNAME>, the reborn Sarevok proved as good as his word.  He returned to the lands he once knew, far more powerful now than he was even before.  Old enemies were startled by his visits, but never for long, and it was not even months later that Sarevok would start a reign of terror in Baldur's Gate that would place him completely in charge of the city.  Resistance was crushed as Sarevok began raising an army for conquest in his own name.  If he could not have the divine power of his father, he would have enough earthly power to satiate his appetite.  Sarevok partook of women as he pleased as his name became a bitter epithet on the tongue of every citizen of the Sword Coast.\n"
"The first victims of his terrible army fell easily, and Sarevok's power grew.  The warrior was maddened, however, to find that the victories gave him no thrill.  The power tasted as ashes, though Sarevok tried many times to drive himself into a frenzy of delight at his achievements.  In the end, his throne grew heavy, and it was with dread acceptance that he greeted the arrival of the inevitable heroes to displace him not a year after his return.\n"
"Sarevok fled into the night, abandoning Baldur's Gate and his dreams of power both.  He became a man haunted by his second chance, hunted by a former life that never was and a possible life that never could be.  Without a destiny and or a true soul of his own, he wandered the Realms... sometimes he brought terror and sometimes he brought nothing but his tired heart, and before long he was gone forever.  Some say that he found his purpose in the great desert, forging a kingdom to last an age.  Some say he traveled to the planes, launching a campaign against the great Mount Celestia.  The truth is unknown, though the tales still persist."

She found it in the control of none other than Isaea Roenal, but she was no longer the wayward child that he expected, and single-handedly brought him to justice for his indiscretions.  She declared herself the inheritor of her father's ducal title, and for once there was no argument from the local nobility.  They snubbed her and her magic, and initially rejoiced when the Cowled Wizards sought to remove her from power.  Nalia demonstrated to them all that she was no-one to trifle with, however, and the Cowled Wizards learned to fear her name.  Over time Nalia became a beloved ruler, respected archmage, and eventually earned a seat on the Amnish Council of Six itself.  The nobility grew to rely on Nalia's leadership, and she would become a prominent figure in Amn for many years, constantly fighting for the good of the common folk and making many frustrated enemies among the nobility and Cowled Wizards both.

The exact truth of the tale is unknown... though it's certainly not  unlike Imoen to encourage an old codger to not be such a stick-in-the-mud, and her later friendship with Elminster is well-documented.  Later tales say Imoen founded a thieves guild that operated all the way to Neverwinter, sparred with the Shadow Thieves and the Zhentarim and even duelled a dragon because (so the story goes) \"he was rude\".
